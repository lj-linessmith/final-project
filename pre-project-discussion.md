# Pre-project discussion
Expectation setting and agreements (what do we each want out of this time, what hours will we keep, what do we do when conflict arises, how will we communicate, especially what hours work will happen over the weekend).
- We will each work approximately one day over the weekend, to make sure we have enough time for rest and can continue to work on the project. 
- When stressed or otherwise needed we each agreed we'd need time to go outside to take 5 and calm down for a couple of minutes. Timing for breaks will be up to the individual, we can all agree we won't waste too much time outside.

## How will you make decisions together? How will you handle conflict?
- with a group of five we can effectively place group votes.
- keeping everyone in the group included in all discussions will help avoid conflicts in the first place.

## How will you, individually and as a team, get the help you need both technically and non-technically?

### Tech:
- Facilitators.
- Asking Team mates for help.

### Non Tech:
- Group discussion.
- Involve facilitators( if needed ).
- Human skills discord/ in person.

## How will you make sure everyone feels included?/How will you decide who needs to be present for which conversations?
 - Making sure everyone has a task to work on, so each person can utilise their time effectively. 
 - Involving everyone in group discussion ( Talking pillow ).
 - We will have teamwide standups, and will let people go if the topic doesn't invlove them and is likely to be a broader conversation. Will have impromtu standups when required to get everyone on the same page. 

## Stress Table 
Person | What it looks like when they're stressed | What helps | What we can do to combat this as a team |



| Order | Name | What it looks like  | What helps                                  | What we can do as a team |
| ----- | -------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1     | Keeley   | CI no longer interact with the group and tend to shut down  | Helps me to have some time out to recompose         | checking in when I may  be communicating less to see if there's anything I'm worried about     |
| 2     | Ton      | If im not able to absorb any information/ my brain doesnt wor | take a short break          | Not to talk about the project just talk about something else           |
| 3     | LJ       | Tend to become quite curt and short in conversation, less talkative more isolation                           | take time to myself and have a distraction for a bit       | make an effort to talk one on one and check in, ideally earlier is better       |
| 4     | Andrew   | I generally just go quiet and shut down for a couple minutes                            | Taking a couple minutes outside to myself with music or something else to distract me        | To help me the best someone can do really is just give me a little company in a quiet spot. Even if we're not talking it helps to have someone there.           |
| 5     | Blue     | When I'm stressed, I get impatient with people, and sometimes get grumpy.                            | Often taking sometime to myself to relize I'm stressed, and distract myself from the situation, before getting back involved.          | Leave me alone! And also let me have a bit of extra time doing something else.     |
